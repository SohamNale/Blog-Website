                <h2>Market Fall leads to start of a Rally
                </h2>
                <h5>August 18, 2022</h5>
                
                <a><img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgzo2WVYY5pVJZ7QeNnx6dW7EBcviuDBzUE0-g9EhFQw_eflw4m-KUBol8GoTwcNUTyCWHWbKWYtvZfp2mtqDDHS2MfeMIxta6T7ANzCSAkZov5jP5k3o1pshTmexWahnranmWg8FbA2e7XZsRvKcQU0dVN4dyien7kM9RuRzNOObL_ojJ63EfrRUCQ=w524-h203" alt="Image" height="400" width="1000"/></a>
                <p>Effects: Every time the market falls and unexpectedly starts to rally, people start talking about all the reasons the rally is hated. In other words, as the market goes down, people sell or go short, and they concoct a fully formed story in their head about how it deserves to go down more, and that the pain has really just begun. So bounces are painful on the PNL and psychologically difficult for people who have internalized the narrative shift.
                <br>
                <br>

                    This rally seems particularly hated and painful. For example, in the latest BofAML Fund Manager Survey, investor sentiment is characterized as "bearish, but no longer apocalyptically bearish." Managers are still holding cash levels well above their long-term average, implying conservative, under-exposed positioning.
                <br>
                <br>
                    What's in it for you: With this rally, we've seen a significant easing of financial conditions. Credit spreads have narrowed. Ceteris paribus, this easing should boost economic activity, and put further upward pressure on inflation, putting more onus on the Fed to tighten even faster. At least in theory the rally is sowing the seeds of its own demise, by pushing further into the future the date of any theoretical Fed pivot.</p>

                <h2>Elon Musk offloads $582 Million of Tesla Shares
                </h2>
                <h5>August 10, 2022</h5>
                <a><img src="https://images.livemint.com/img/2021/12/22/600x338/TESLA-MUSK-STAKE-0_1637020549670_1640146511751.JPG" alt="Image" height="400" width="1000"/></a>
                
                <p>  Elon Musk sold 583,611 shares in Tesla Inc. for $528 million, meaning he’s now more than three-quarters of the way to making good on his pledge to sell 10% of his stake in the electric carmaker. 
                <br>
                <br>
                    Musk has been offloading Tesla stock since asking his Twitter followers in November whether he should sell some of his stakes. He said he would exercise options toward the end of the year and set up a share-trading plan prior to the poll. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The billionaire has now sold around 13.5 million shares for about $14.1 billion, regulatory filings show. He’ll need to dispose of some 17 million shares all up to offload 10% of his interest in the U.S.-based EV pioneer, assuming his pledge excludes exercisable options.
                    <br><br>
                    Tesla shares have fallen 24% since a peak on Nov. 4, just prior to Musk’s Twitter poll, to which the majority of answered “yes."
                    <br><br>
                    Musk, 50, is the world’s richest man, at top of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index with a fortune of $244.9 billion. He said in a Tweet late Sunday that he would pay more than $11 billion in taxes this year.</p>
